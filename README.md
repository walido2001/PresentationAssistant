# Presentation Assistant (State: Work In Progress)
A webapp that provides feedback on the presenter's weaknesses during presentations and/or public speaking atmospheres.. 

# Estimated Completion Date
End of the summer (sometime around end of August)

# Features
-> Get real-time feedback on the presenter's non-informative side of the presentation (body language). <br />
-> Ability to recieve a report summing the feedback by the end of presentation.<br />

# Plan (Subject to change)
## Phase 1 (May - June) 
Learn and develop the AI implementation of Facial Recognition, Audio Analysis, and possibly hand recognition. <br />
By the end of this phase, the program must be able to output what the user is doing on camera (Where they are looking, changes in audio, and how the hands are moving)

## Phase 2 (1/2 Of July)
Implement the interface of the web app. <br />
By the end of this phase, a decent looking webapp must be available.

## Phase 3 (Second 1/2 Of July - August)
Connecting the web app interface to the AI backend to have a complete functional web app that performs its function. <br />
By the end of this phase, a functional prototype must be available for use. 

# Side Note
Features and due dates are subject to change given that I have no idea what I'm doing and how I'm going about this.
